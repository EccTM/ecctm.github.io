**Conky Gemini** is a Rainmeter skin set for displaying system information.

## Project Source

{% include icon-github.html username="EccTM" %}/[Conky Gemini](https://github.com/EccTM/Conky-Gemini)

## Origin

[![Conky running on my Arch Linux netbook](/assets/images/project-conky-gemini-pic1.png){: .align-right width="512" }](/assets/images/project-conky-gemini-pic1.png)

I previously used {% include icon-github.html username="brndnmtthws" %}/[Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) on an Arch Linux netbook, and really missed having all my system info available at a glance when I swapped over to my Windows 10 desktop. While looking for Windows alternatives to Conky, I discovered a Rainmeter, and a skin set I really liked the style of called [Gemini Suite](https://www.deviantart.com/trucola/art/The-Gemini-Suite-805582955), created by TruCola.

I started tweaking TruCola's Gemini Suite skin to include in the Conky-style icons and graphs that I liked, and that spawned the card-based Conky-Gemini as it is now.
