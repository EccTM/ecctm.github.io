**Noodles** is a Bootstrap 5.1 based startpage that I made for myself after finding my Bookmarks bar had started to overflow with subfolders and shortcuts.

## Project Source

{% include icon-github.html username="EccTM" %}/[Noodles](https://github.com/EccTM/Noodles)

## Origin

I started looking online for an alternative to my poor Bookmarks bar, and came across some beautifully designed startpages, but they had an issue. They all prioritised style over practicality, and often, ended up adding more clicks to my web browsing.

I decided to take the oportunity to review what sites and shortcuts I actually use, and simplify it everything down to a single page of shortcuts that take me to the places I visit most.

## Features

- simple logo buttons for each shortcut
- shortcut names appear via tooltip on hover
- swappable light and dark themes (that are remembered per-device)

## Possible Improvements

Seeing as I threw it together for my own use, the shortcuts are currently hard-coded into the project's `index.html` file. I'd like to expand on it and read the shortcuts in from a json file.
